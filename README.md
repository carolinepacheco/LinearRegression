Linear Regression is one of the most popular supervised machine learning. It predicts values within a continuous range, (e.g. sale prices, life expectancy, temperature, etc) instead of trying to classify them into categories (e.g. car, bus, bike and others). The main goal of the linear regression is to find the best fit line which describes the relationship between the data.

The best-fitting line (or regression line) is represented by:

where m is the slope of the line known as angular gradient and b is the point at which the line crosses the y-axis also known as linear gradient.
